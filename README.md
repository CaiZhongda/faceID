### Train_Model
1. Specify your mask size in 'num_output' (the value should equal to height x width of the mask)

		
		layer {
		  name: "mask_ip"
		  type: "InnerProduct"
		  bottom: "mask_conv3"
		  top: "mask_ip"
		  param {
		    name: "mask_ip_w"
		    lr_mult: 1
		  }
		  param {
		    name: "mask_ip_b"
		    lr_mult: 2
		  }
		  inner_product_param {
		    num_output: 572     # change it based on your network
		    weight_filler {
		      type: "constant"
		    }
		    bias_filler {
		      type: "constant"
		    }
		  }
		}
		
2. Choose the location to insert the mask layer. I placed it after 'pool2'.

		
		layer {
		  name: "mask"
		  type: "Mask"
		  bottom: "pool2"
		  bottom: "mask_2d"
		  top: "masked_pool2"
		  mask_param {
		    scale: 1
		  }
		}

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like
